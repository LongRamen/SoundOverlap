In vanilla, each sound has a maximum number of instances that can be playing at once. For most sounds, this limit is 1. After the limit is reached, if a new instance of the sound needs to be played, one of the currently playing instances gets replaced.

This mod completely removes this limit, meaning any number of instances of the same sound can overlap.

Now you can burst your eardrums (and maybe your RAM) to your heart's content.
